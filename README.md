# What-am-I-doing-
At 53 years old I am starting a new career path, coding, and I am scared to death because I am clueless. 
I was a real estate appraiser for 14 years then in 2008 the bubble crashed and so did everything else. I have tried other jobs other careers and many other ways of making a living. A long time ago I worked as a professional photographer and so I decided to give that a try again. It is a different world from when I worked in that profession. I love it and will still practice it as a hobby, however for now I am going to try and learn to write computer code.
